## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Face Recognition Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** project implements a **machine learning-based face recognition system**. It uses **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction from facial images, making the recognition process efficient and accurate. 

> ✨ **Why PCA for Face Recognition?**
> - Reduces **dimensionality** while preserving critical facial features.
> - Enhances **computational efficiency** for recognition.
> - Allows for effective face classification using fewer principal components.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Reduces data dimensions while retaining facial structures.  
✅ **Face Detection using OpenCV** – Detects faces before feature extraction.  
✅ **Training & Classification** – Uses PCA-transformed eigenfaces for recognition.  
✅ **Supports Live Webcam Input** – Can recognize faces in real-time.  
✅ **Scalable Dataset Support** – Can train on multiple faces and improve accuracy.

## 📌 Project Scope

### ✅ **In-Scope:**
✔️ Face detection & recognition using **PCA + OpenCV**.  
✔️ Image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization).  
✔️ Real-time face recognition using webcam input.  
✔️ Eigenface generation and PCA-based feature extraction.  

### ❌ **Out-of-Scope:**
❌ Deep learning-based face recognition (CNNs, DNNs).  
❌ Multi-angle face recognition (works best with frontal images).  
❌ Real-time dataset expansion through user interaction.
